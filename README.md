Distributors connect manufacturers and retailers, while retailers can manage inventory, track orders, and more.

Creation and management of orders across three domains of the supply chain.
Integrated cron jobs for real-time simulation of manufacturing.
Added a connections feature for linking users at various levels of the supply chain.
